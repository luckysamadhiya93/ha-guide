========
RabbitMQ
========

An AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) compliant message bus is
required for most OpenStack components in order to coordinate the
execution of jobs entered into the system.

The most popular AMQP implementation used in OpenStack installations
is RabbitMQ.

RabbitMQ nodes fail over both on the application and the
infrastructure layers.

The application layer is controlled by the ``oslo.messaging``
configuration options for multiple AMQP hosts. If the AMQP node fails,
the application reconnects to the next one configured within the
specified reconnect interval. The specified reconnect interval
constitutes its SLA.

On the infrastructure layer, the SLA is the time for which RabbitMQ
cluster reassembles. Several cases are possible. The Mnesia keeper
node is the master of the corresponding Pacemaker resource for
RabbitMQ; when it fails, the result is a full AMQP cluster downtime
interval. Normally, its SLA is no more than several minutes. Failure
of another node that is a slave of the corresponding Pacemaker
resource for RabbitMQ results in no AMQP cluster downtime at all.

Making the RabbitMQ service highly available involves the following steps:

- :ref:`Install RabbitMQ<rabbitmq-install>`

- :ref:`Configure RabbitMQ for HA queues<rabbitmq-configure>`

- :ref:`Configure OpenStack services to use Rabbit HA queues
  <rabbitmq-services>`

.. note::

   Access to RabbitMQ is not normally handled by HAproxy. Instead,
   consumers must be supplied with the full list of hosts running
   RabbitMQ with ``rabbit_hosts`` and turn on the ``rabbit_ha_queues``
   option.

   Jon Eck found the `core issue
   <http://people.redhat.com/jeckersb/private/vip-failover-tcp-persist.html>`_
   and went into some detail regarding the `history and solution
   <http://john.eckersberg.com/improving-ha-failures-with-tcp-timeouts.html>`_
   on his blog.

   In summary though:

   The source address for the connection from HAProxy back to the
   client is the VIP address. However the VIP address is no longer
   present on the host. This means that the network (IP) layer
   deems the packet unroutable, and informs the transport (TCP)
   layer. TCP, however, is a reliable transport. It knows how to
   handle transient errors and will retry. And so it does.

   In this case that is a problem though, because:

   TCP generally holds on to hope for a long time. A ballpark
   estimate is somewhere on the order of tens of minutes (30
   minutes is commonly referenced). During this time it will keep
   probing and trying to deliver the data.

   It is important to note that HAProxy has no idea that any of this is
   happening. As far as its process is concerned, it called
   ``write()`` with the data and the kernel returned success. The
   resolution is already understood and just needs to make its way
   through a review.

.. _rabbitmq-configure:

Configure RabbitMQ for HA queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[TODO: This section should begin with a brief mention
about what HA queues are and why they are valuable, etc]

We are building a cluster of RabbitMQ nodes to construct a RabbitMQ broker,
which is a logical grouping of several Erlang nodes.

The following components/services can work with HA queues:

[TODO: replace "currently" with specific release names]

[TODO: Does this list need to be updated? Perhaps we need a table
that shows each component and the earliest release that allows it
to work with HA queues.]

- OpenStack Compute
- OpenStack Block Storage
- OpenStack Networking
- Telemetry

We have to consider that, while exchanges and bindings
survive the loss of individual nodes,
queues and their messages do not
because a queue and its contents are located on one node.
If we lose this node, we also lose the queue.

Mirrored queues in RabbitMQ improve
the availability of service since it is resilient to failures.

Production servers should run (at least) three RabbitMQ servers;
for testing and demonstration purposes,
it is possible to run only two servers.
In this section, we configure two nodes,
called ``rabbit1`` and ``rabbit2``.
To build a broker, we need to ensure
that all nodes have the same Erlang cookie file.

[TODO: Should the example instead use a minimum of three nodes?]

#. To do so, stop RabbitMQ everywhere and copy the cookie
   from the first node to each of the other node(s):

   .. code-block:: console

      # scp /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie root@NODE:/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie

#. On each target node, verify the correct owner,
   group, and permissions of the file :file:`erlang.cookie`.

   .. code-block:: console

      # chown rabbitmq:rabbitmq /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
      # chmod 400 /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie

#. Start RabbitMQ on all nodes and verify that the nodes are running:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl cluster_status
      Cluster status of node rabbit@NODE...
      [{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@NODE]}]},
       {running_nodes,[rabbit@NODE]},
       {partitions,[]}]
      ...done.

#. Run the following commands on each node except the first one:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl stop_app
      Stopping node rabbit@NODE...
      ...done.
      # rabbitmqctl join_cluster rabbit@rabbit1
      # rabbitmqctl start_app
      Starting node rabbit@NODE ...
      ...done.

#. To verify the cluster status:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl cluster_status
      Cluster status of node rabbit@NODE...
      [{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1]},{ram,[rabbit@NODE]}]}, \
          {running_nodes,[rabbit@NODE,rabbit@rabbit1]}]

   If the cluster is working,
   you can create usernames and passwords for the queues.

#. To ensure that all queues except those with auto-generated names
   are mirrored across all running nodes,
   set the ``ha-mode`` policy key to all
   by running the following command on one of the nodes:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl set_policy ha-all '^(?!amq\.).*' '{"ha-mode": "all"}'

More information is available in the RabbitMQ documentation:

- `Highly Available Queues <http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html>`_
- `Clustering Guide <https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html>`_

.. note::

   As another option to make RabbitMQ highly available, RabbitMQ contains the
   OCF scripts for the Pacemaker cluster resource agents since version 3.5.7.
   It provides the active/active RabbitMQ cluster with mirrored queues.
   For more information, see `Auto-configuration of a cluster with
   a Pacemaker <http://www.rabbitmq.com/pacemaker.html>`_.

.. _rabbitmq-services:

Configure OpenStack services to use Rabbit HA queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have to configure the OpenStack components
to use at least two RabbitMQ nodes.

Do this configuration on all services using RabbitMQ:

#. RabbitMQ HA cluster host:port pairs:

   ::

      rabbit_hosts=rabbit1:5672,rabbit2:5672,rabbit3:5672

#. How frequently to retry connecting with RabbitMQ:
   [TODO: document the unit of measure here? Seconds?]

   ::

      rabbit_retry_interval=1

#. How long to back-off for between retries when connecting to RabbitMQ:
   [TODO: document the unit of measure here? Seconds?]

   ::

      rabbit_retry_backoff=2

#. Maximum retries with trying to connect to RabbitMQ (infinite by default):

   ::

      rabbit_max_retries=0

#. Use durable queues in RabbitMQ:

   ::

      rabbit_durable_queues=true

#. Use HA queues in RabbitMQ (x-ha-policy: all):

   ::

      rabbit_ha_queues=true

.. note::

   If you change the configuration from an old set-up
   that did not use HA queues, you should restart the service:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl stop_app
      # rabbitmqctl reset
      # rabbitmqctl start_app
