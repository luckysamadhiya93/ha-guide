========
RabbitMQ
========

RabbitMQ is the default AMQP server used by many OpenStack services.

RabbitMQ nodes fail over both on the application and the
infrastructure layers.

The application layer is controlled by the ``oslo.messaging``
configuration options for multiple AMQP hosts. If the AMQP node fails,
the application reconnects to the next one configured within the
specified reconnect interval. The specified reconnect interval
constitutes its SLA.

On the infrastructure layer, the SLA is the time for which RabbitMQ
cluster reassembles. Several cases are possible. The Mnesia keeper
node is the master of the corresponding Pacemaker resource for
RabbitMQ; when it fails, the result is a full AMQP cluster downtime
interval. Normally, its SLA is no more than several minutes. Failure
of another node that is a slave of the corresponding Pacemaker
resource for RabbitMQ results in no AMQP cluster downtime at all.

Making the RabbitMQ service highly available involves the following steps:

- :ref:`Install RabbitMQ<rabbitmq-install>`

- :ref:`Configure RabbitMQ for HA queues<rabbitmq-configure>`

- :ref:`Configure OpenStack services to use Rabbit HA queues
  <rabbitmq-services>`

.. _rabbitmq-configure:

Configure RabbitMQ for HA queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[TODO: This section should begin with a brief mention
about what HA queues are and why they are valuable, etc]

We are building a cluster of RabbitMQ nodes to construct a RabbitMQ broker,
which is a logical grouping of several Erlang nodes.

The following components/services can work with HA queues:

[TODO: replace "currently" with specific release names]

[TODO: Does this list need to be updated? Perhaps we need a table
that shows each component and the earliest release that allows it
to work with HA queues.]

- OpenStack Compute
- OpenStack Block Storage
- OpenStack Networking
- Telemetry

We have to consider that, while exchanges and bindings
survive the loss of individual nodes,
queues and their messages do not
because a queue and its contents are located on one node.
If we lose this node, we also lose the queue.

Mirrored queues in RabbitMQ improve
the availability of service since it is resilient to failures.

Production servers should run (at least) three RabbitMQ servers;
for testing and demonstration purposes,
it is possible to run only two servers.
In this section, we configure two nodes,
called ``rabbit1`` and ``rabbit2``.
To build a broker, we need to ensure
that all nodes have the same Erlang cookie file.

[TODO: Should the example instead use a minimum of three nodes?]

#. To do so, stop RabbitMQ everywhere and copy the cookie
   from the first node to each of the other node(s):

   .. code-block:: console

      # scp /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie root@NODE:/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie

#. On each target node, verify the correct owner,
   group, and permissions of the file :file:`erlang.cookie`.

   .. code-block:: console

      # chown rabbitmq:rabbitmq /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
      # chmod 400 /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie

#. Start RabbitMQ on all nodes and verify that the nodes are running:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl cluster_status
      Cluster status of node rabbit@NODE...
      [{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@NODE]}]},
       {running_nodes,[rabbit@NODE]},
       {partitions,[]}]
      ...done.

#. Run the following commands on each node except the first one:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl stop_app
      Stopping node rabbit@NODE...
      ...done.
      # rabbitmqctl join_cluster rabbit@rabbit1
      # rabbitmqctl start_app
      Starting node rabbit@NODE ...
      ...done.

#. To verify the cluster status:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl cluster_status
      Cluster status of node rabbit@NODE...
      [{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@rabbit1]},{ram,[rabbit@NODE]}]}, \
          {running_nodes,[rabbit@NODE,rabbit@rabbit1]}]

   If the cluster is working,
   you can create usernames and passwords for the queues.

#. To ensure that all queues except those with auto-generated names
   are mirrored across all running nodes,
   set the ``ha-mode`` policy key to all
   by running the following command on one of the nodes:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl set_policy ha-all '^(?!amq\.).*' '{"ha-mode": "all"}'

- `Highly Available Queues <http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html>`_
- `Clustering Guide <https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html>`_


.. _rabbitmq-services:

Configure OpenStack services to use Rabbit HA queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have to configure the OpenStack components
to use at least two RabbitMQ nodes.

Do this configuration on all services using RabbitMQ:

#. RabbitMQ HA cluster host:port pairs:
   [TODO: Add rabbit3 if you agree]

   ::

      rabbit_hosts=rabbit1:5672,rabbit2:5672

#. How frequently to retry connecting with RabbitMQ:
   [TODO: document the unit of measure here? Seconds?]

   ::

      rabbit_retry_interval=1

#. How long to back-off for between retries when connecting to RabbitMQ:
   [TODO: document the unit of measure here? Seconds?]

   ::

      rabbit_retry_backoff=2

#. Maximum retries with trying to connect to RabbitMQ (infinite by default):

   ::

      rabbit_max_retries=0

#. Use durable queues in RabbitMQ:

   ::

      rabbit_durable_queues=true

#. Use HA queues in RabbitMQ (x-ha-policy: all):

   ::

      rabbit_ha_queues=true

.. note::

   If you change the configuration from an old set-up
   that did not use HA queues, you should restart the service:

   .. code-block:: console

      # rabbitmqctl stop_app
      # rabbitmqctl reset
      # rabbitmqctl start_app
