=============

You must configure NTP to properly synchronize services among nodes.
We recommend that you configure the controller node to reference
more accurate (lower stratum) servers and other nodes to reference
the controller node. For more information, see the
`Install Guides <http://docs.openstack.org/#install-guides>`_.
